# An attempt to extend xG gain

This project contains the code for my work about extending xG gain described [here](https://kubamichalczyk.github.io/2018/11/18/An-attempt-to-extend-xG-gain.html). Anyone with the access to Premier League 2017-2018 data collected by Opta Pro is highly encouraged to play around with it.
